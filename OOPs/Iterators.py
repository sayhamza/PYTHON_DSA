# Python Iterators
# An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.

# An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

# Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().

# Iterator vs Iterable
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

# All these objects have a iter() method which is used to get an iterator:

# ExampleGet your own Python Server
# Return an iterator from a tuple, and print each value:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
myit = iter(mytuple)

print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))
print(next(myit))


# Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.

# As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.

# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.

# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.

# Example
# Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
